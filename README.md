# embryoidNeuralODE
Neural ODE Implementation for Invertible Distribution Transport between an Embryoid Cell Distribution and the Gaussian Distribution

Includes the following feature plots plots:

- PHATE vs PCA
    
    + 1 figure with two subplots, one for each embedding. 
    
    + cells are colored by time.

- generated cells vs real cells in PCA space
    
    + 1 figure
    
    + real cells use a different marker than generated cells
    
    + cells are colored by time

- generated cells vs real cells expression
    
    + 1 figure
    
        - can be 10 subplots (2 rows of 5) 

            + one row for generated 
        
            + one row for ground truth 
            
    + generated data is colored differently than ground truth data
